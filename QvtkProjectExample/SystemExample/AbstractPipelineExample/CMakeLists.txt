# @file	TemplateCMakeLists.txt
# @brief	A template CMakeLists.txt which can automatically generate project
# @author	WUZHUOBIN
# @version	1.4.0
# @since	Sep.19.2017
# 
# This template is for generating CMake project easily. Only a few steps.
# 1.	Make a good folder name as the parent, because it is going to be your 
#		CMake Project name. 
# 2.	Place all header files and implementation files to your parent folder. 
#		If there is no header files and implementation files, skip this part. 
# 3.	Create a folder "main" to place your main function. It has to be named 
#		as "name.cpp". If there is no or a library is being created, skip this 
#		part. 
# 4.	Rename "TemplateCMakeLists.txt" to "CMakeLists.txt".
